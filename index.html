    If I could save time in a bottle
    The first thing that I'd like to do
    Is to save every day
    'Til eternity passes away
    Just to spend them with you

    If I could make days last forever
    If words could make wishes come true
    I'd save every day like a treasure and then
    Again, I would spend them with you

    But there never seems to be enough time
    To do the things you want to do
    Once you find them
    I've looked around enough to know
    That you're the one I want to go
    Through time with

    If I had a box just for wishes
    And dreams that had never come true
    The box would be empty
    Except for the memory
    Of how they were answered by you

    But there never seems to be enough time
    To do the things you want to do
    Once you find them
    I've looked around enough to know
    That you're the one I want to go
    Through time with
